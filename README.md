# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to create a dashboard that shows an interactive webpage. To visualize the bacterial data for each volunteer, select the Subject test ID in the dropdown panel and the dashboard will update accordingly.

Upon selecting the test subject ID No, you will get a summary of the demographic information of the anonymous volunteer.

**There are 3 different charts in the dashboard:**
1) Top 10 Bacteria Cultures Found
2) Belly Button Washing Frequency
3) Bacteria Cultures Per Sample
